DekNek3D Conversion Service
===========================

A simple backend service for converting uploaded GLB files to other formats (STL, PLY, OBJ) and returning a downloadable file (or ZIP for multi-file outputs).

Prerequisites
-------------
- Node.js (v16+ recommended)
- npm

Quick start
-----------
1. Change into the backend folder:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
4. Server runs at: `http://localhost:8000` (default port 8000)

Dependencies ✅
---------------
These are the packages required by the backend (listed in `backend/package.json`):

- `express` — web framework
- `multer` — file upload handling
- `cors` — Cross-Origin Resource Sharing
- `@gltf-transform/core`, `@gltf-transform/extensions`, `@gltf-transform/functions` — GLTF/GLB manipulation
- `three` — 3D model utilities
- `draco3dgltf` — Draco compression support
- `meshoptimizer` — mesh optimization
- `archiver` — zip creation

API Routes 🔧
------------
1) POST /upload
- Description: Upload a `.glb` file and request a conversion.
- Method: POST
- Content type: multipart/form-data
- Fields:
  - `file` — the uploaded GLB file (must have `.glb` extension)
  - `format` — one of: `glb` (optimize), `stl`, `ply`, `obj`
- Notes:
  - Max file size configured to 20 MB.
  - `ply` and `obj` conversions are returned as a `.zip` (containing one or more files).
  - Temporary files are stored in `uploads/` and results go to `outputs/` and are removed after download.
- Success response example:
  ```json
  {
    "success": true,
    "fileId": "<output-filename>",
    "downloadUrl": "/download/<output-filename>"
  }
  ```
- Error responses: 400 for unsupported format, 500 for conversion failures.

Example curl (upload & convert to STL):

```bash
curl -X POST -F "file=@model.glb" -F "format=stl" http://localhost:8000/upload
```

2) GET /download/:fileId
- Description: Download a converted file by `fileId` (as returned by `/upload`). The server deletes the file after a successful download.
- Example:

```bash
curl -O http://localhost:8000/download/<fileId>
```

Notes & Tips 💡
---------------
- Ensure `uploads/` and `outputs/` are writable by the server process.
- Consider adding `outputs/`, `uploads/`, and `node_modules/` to `.gitignore` (temporary files and dependencies should not be committed).
- If you want to change the port or other configuration, add environment variable support and document it here.

If you'd like, I can also add the `.gitignore` entries and a usage example script or Postman collection. Let me know which you'd prefer next.
